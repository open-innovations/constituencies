<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>These figures were published by the HMRC and DWP for the first time in March 2020 and updated in March 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Relative poverty</strong>: households with income below 60% of the median (middle) household income. This can be seen as a measure of inequality between low- and middle-income households.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute poverty</strong>: households with income below 60% of (inflation-adjusted) median income in 2010/11. This is often used to look at how living standards of low-income households are changing over time.</p>
<p>In these statistics, income is measured before housing costs are taken into account.  The median is the point where half of household incomes are higher and half lower.</p>
