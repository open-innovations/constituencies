<p>We've attempted to match all the gambling premises in the register to 2024 Parliamentary Constituencies using their postcodes. Around 19 entries (out of 8,743) in the register have no valid postcode and they have not been included in the totals. Around 55 entries in the register give no "Premises Activity" and these have been excluded from the totals too.</p>
