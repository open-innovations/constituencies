<p>The government states that the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2">"fundamental aim" of the green belt</a> "is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open" around urban areas. England had around 16,384 km&sup2; (or 6,326 square miles) of green belt land at the end of March 2023, covering 12.6% of England's land area. The green belt is clustered around 15 urban cores; the largest are London (5,085 km&sup2;), Merseyside and Greater Manchester (2,477 km&sup2;) and South and West Yorkshire (including Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford, 2,465 km&sup2;).</p>
