<p>These projections are taken from Copernicus' <a href="https://atlas.climate.copernicus.eu/atlas">Interactive Climate Atlas</a>, which is a constantly updated version of the IPCC's Climate Atlas:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#winter-rainfall">winter rainfall</a></li>
	<li><a href="#summer-rainfall">summer rainfall</a></li>
	<li><a href="#wettest">wettest 5 days</a></li>
	<li><a href="#hottest">hottest day (&deg;C)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#temperature">annual temperature change (&deg;C)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The future projections show only the average of an ensemble called <a href="https://www.euro-cordex.net/">EuroCORDEX</a>, which downscales a range of different global projections using an international collection of regional climate models that all use a common spatial grid of roughly 11km over Europe. To measure climate rather than weather, you need to average over multiple years. So the projections show the difference between conditions averaged over 2021-2040 and those averaged over 1981-2010.</p>
<div class="warning padded padded-bottom">The projections use a scenario of global carbon emissions called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#RCP_4.5">RCP4.5</a>, which is roughly the trajectory that we're following. However as they only show climate changes in the near-term, the impact of the scenario is pretty minimal as they're mainly set by our past emssions.</div>
<p>This analysis was <a href="https://oacd-ucl.github.io/climate-hexmaps/">initially undertaken by Georgia Willits</a> as part of her dissertation research for her Climate Change MSc at UCL Geography. It has <a href="https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/UK-climate-by-mp/">since been taken on and updated by Prof. Chris Brierley</a>.</p>

<h2>Winter rainfall projections{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'winter-rainfall'}) }}</h2>
<p>Winter is the wettest season across most of the UK. Not all the country has the same amount of rainfall, with more falling on the Western side of the country. Therefore it is common to show rainfall changes as percentages. Here winter is taken as December, January and February.</p>

	"component": comp.oi.map.hex_cartogram,
	"config": "rainfall_winter"
}) }}

<h2>Summer rainfall projections{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'summer-rainfall'}) }}</h2>
<p>Summer is drier than winter in many parts of the UK (although East Anglia is dry all year round). It is common to show rainfall changes as percentages, as they are often more interpretable than using mm/day. Here Summer is taken as June, July and August.</p>

	"component": comp.oi.map.hex_cartogram,
	"config": "rainfall_summer"
}) }}

<h2>Wettest 5 days projections{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'wettest'}) }}</h2>
<p>Flooding is caused by heavy rainfall, which can lead to rivers overflowing, flash floods and landslides. The amount of rain that falls in a single day can be important, but the amount that falls over a few days can be even more so. This indicator shows the percentage change in amount of rain that falls on the five wettest consecutive days of the year.</p>
{{ comp.wrapper({
	"page": page,
	"component": comp.oi.map.hex_cartogram,
	"config": "wettest_5_days"
}) }}

<h2>Hottest day projections{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'hottest'}) }}</h2>
<p>Heatwaves are an increasing threat under climate change. They can affect the health of people, animals and plants, and can also affect the amount of energy we use to cool our homes and buildings. They can be rather tricky to measure, so instead this indicator shows the change in the temperature of the hottest day of the average year.</p>
{{ comp.wrapper({
	"page": page,
	"component": comp.oi.map.hex_cartogram,
	"config": "hottest_day"
}) }}

<h2>Temperature projections{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'temperature'}) }}</h2>
<p>Changes in temperature are a headline response of climate change. This is because it is easy(ish) to measure and many more consequential impacts track it. This indicator shows the change in the annual temperature, averaged over all the years.</p>

<h2>Rainfall anomaly{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'rainfall-anomaly'}) }}</h2>
<p>The observed rainfall anomaly in 2019 (mm/day).</p>
{{ comp.wrapper({
	"page": page,
	"component": comp.oi.map.hex_cartogram,
	"config": "rainfall_anomaly"

<h2>Rainfall{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'rainfall'}) }}</h2>
<p>Annual mean change in rainfall (mm/day) for the years 2051-2080 (so roughly 2065) compared to 1981-2010. Some western coastal areas will be getting more rain per day on average but most of the country will be getting less rain across the year.</p>
{{ comp.wrapper({
	"page": page,
	"component": comp.oi.map.hex_cartogram,
	"config": "rainfall"
}) }}


<h2>Wettest days{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'wettest'}) }}</h2>
<p>The change in the amount of rain falling over the wettest 5 days of the year (mm/day) for the years 2051-2080 (so roughly 2065) compared to 1981-2010. For most of the country the wettest days will be getting wetter. Almost everywhere will be getting more rain on the five wettest days of the year. The western side of the country, particularly parts of Wales and Cumbria will be getting significantly more rain on those days.</p>
{{ comp.wrapper({
	"page": page,
	"component": comp.oi.map.hex_cartogram,
	"config": "wettest_days"
}) }}


<h2>Temperature{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'temperature'}) }}</h2>
<p>Annual mean change in temperature by 2065 (Â°C) for the years 2051-2080 (so roughly 2065) compared to 1981-2010. Everywhere will be hotter but it will be more pronounced in the south and London.</p>
{{ comp.wrapper({
	"page": page,

<h2>Drought{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'drought'}) }}</h2>
<p>The number of extra days experiencing drought for the years 2051-2080 (so roughly 2065) compared to 1981-2010. Almost everywhere will be experiencing more days of drought. The effects won't be as large in Scotland, the north west of England, and parts of Wales.</p>

<h2>Heatwaves{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'heatwaves'}) }}</h2>
<p>The change in the number of days classed as heatwaves for the years 2051-2080 (so roughly 2065) compared to 1981-2010. Everywhere will be getting more days of heatwaves but the situation will be worst in the south eastern part of England.</p>

<h2>Warmest day{{ comp.anchor({ anchor: 'warmest'}) }}</h2>
<p>The change in the temperature of the warmest day of year for the years 2051-2080 (so roughly 2065) compared to 1981-2010.</p>
